# Dynamic-Pricing-of-Electronic-products

The electronic products market is one of the fastest changing areas in todayâ€™s global economy. A smartphone that is popular today can quickly become outdated in just a few months. This rapid change happens with all types of electronic products making it exciting but also challenging to set prices. Dynamic pricing is a smart solution for this problem. It allows prices to change in real time based on things like supply and demand, competitor prices and customer behavior. This strategy helps businesses sell older products quickly when new models come out and it lets them adjust prices quickly to stay competitive. 
The main goal of this research is to use different machine learning models like linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression and decision tree regression, to set dynamic prices for electronic products. These algorithms can analyze large amounts of data about the market to find patterns and predict future demand. This helps businesses respond quickly to changes and set prices that maximize profits. Also several data preparation steps were carried out such as converting categorical data, filling in missing values and standardizing data. These techniques and algorithms were used with Python and its machine learning libraries. The results were analyzed and the performance of the algorithms was evaluated and compared visually for discussion.

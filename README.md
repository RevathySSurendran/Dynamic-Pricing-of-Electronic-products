# Dynamic-Pricing-of-Electronic-products

The electronic products market is one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving sectors in today's global economy. From smart phones and laptops to smart home devices and wearables, electronic products are an integral part of modern life. For example, a smart phone model that's in high demand today can quickly become outdated in just a few months. This rapid turnover isn't limited to phones - we see similar patterns with all electronic products. The speed of innovation is breath-taking, but it also makes pricing these products a real headache.

This is where dynamic pricing can be applied. It's a smart approach that allows prices to adapt in real-time based on current market conditions such as supply and demand, rival prices, customer behaviour etc. Dynamic pricing can help clear out older stock quickly when a new model comes out enabling businesses to stay competitive by adjusting their prices quickly in response to market trends or competitor actions. It also allows retailers to profit on periods of high demand like during holiday shopping seasons or after a popular product launch.

The main goal of this research is to employ various machine learning models including linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression etc to perform dynamic pricing of electronic products. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data on current market conditions to identify patterns and predict future demand. It allows businesses to quickly respond to changes in market conditions and personalize and optimize pricing for maximum profitability. The research involved implementing various multiple data preparation strategies such as encoding categorical data, handling missing values and standardisation. These techniques and algorithms were executed using the Python programming language with machine learning libraries. Prediction results were obtained and algorithm performance measures were accessed, which were then visualized for comparison and discussion.
